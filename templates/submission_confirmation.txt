#SUBJECT: [CSCI 201] Assignment Submission Confirmation
Greetings from alghanmi-bot,

At the assignment's deadline, I started collecting information about your submission to report to my masters so they could start grading your assignment.

Here is the information I will report about you:
	Name: $FIRST_NAME$ $LAST_NAME$
	USC Email: $USC_USERNAME$@usc.edu
	GitHub Account: <a href="https://github.com/$GH_USERNAME$">$GH_USERNAME$</a>

I will, also, report this as your submission of record:
	Repository: <a href="https://github.com/$REPO_URL$">$ORG_NAME$/$REPO_NAME$</a>
	SHA: <a href="$COMMIT_URL$">$COMMIT_ID$</a>
	Committed on: $COMMIT_TIMESTAMP$

Take care,
Rami's bot
