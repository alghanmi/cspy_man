#SUBJECT: [CSCI 201] Assignment Submission Confirmation
Greetings from alghanmi-bot,

At the assignment's deadline, I started collecting information about your submission to report to my masters so they could start grading your assignment.

Here is the information I will report about you:
	Name: <b>$FIRST_NAME$ $LAST_NAME$</b>
	USC Email: <b>$USC_USERNAME$@usc.edu</b>
	GitHub Account: <b><a href="https://github.com/$GH_USERNAME$">$GH_USERNAME$</a></b>

I will, also, report this as your submission of record:
	Repository: <b><a href="https://github.com/$REPO_URL$">$ORG_NAME$/$REPO_NAME$</a></b>
	SHA: <b><a href="$COMMIT_URL$">$COMMIT_ID$</a></b>
	Committed on: <b>$COMMIT_TIMESTAMP$</b>
	Commit Message: <b>$COMMIT_COMMENT$</b>

Take care,
Rami's bot
