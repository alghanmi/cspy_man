Greetings from c(s, py | man),

Your recent update to the <a href="$REPO_URL$">$REPO_NAME$</a> repository triggered the website to be re-generated and deployed. Please visit the website to confirm that the changes were properly applied.

The changes up to commit <a href="$COMMIT_URL$">$COMMIT_ID$</a> dated $COMMIT_TIMESTAMP$ were applied to the website before it was deployed.

You are receiving this email because the commit had the following author information:
	Name: $AUTHOR_NAME$
	E-Mail: $AUTHOR_EMAIL$
	GitHub Username: $GH_USERNAME$

For diagnostic reasons, the following is a log of the script output:
<code>$SCRIPT_LOG$</code>

Take care,
